# Software Modeling
Software models are ways of expressing a software design. Usually some sort of abstract language or pictures are used to express the software design.

## Analysis Modeling

 Analysis Model is a technical representation of the system.Analysis model operates as a link between the <b>System Description</b> and the  <b>Design Model</b>.
In the analysis model, information, functions and the behaviour of the system is defined and these are translated into the architecture, interface and component level design in the 'Design Modeling'.

The analysis model must achieve three primary objectives: 
* To describe what the customer requires
* To establish a basis for the creation of a software design
* To define a set of requirements that can be validated once the software is built.
