## User Story
A user story is an informal explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. These stories should be written using non-technical language to provide context to the development team.

A user story is typically told in one sentence, following the format:<b> “As a [persona], I want to [software goal], so that [result].”</b>

#### Tips for achieving an effective user story
In addition to the three steps outlined above, an effective user story should follow the 3 Cs and INVEST acronym. Both of these help to take your user stories to the next level, resulting in more effective software updates. 


#### 3 Cs of User Story
The 3 Cs are Card, Conversation, and Confirmation. The 3 Cs break each user story into three different benchmarks, creating a more organized process. Let’s dive into each of the 3 Cs to gain a better understanding:

<b>Card:</b> A written description of the user story used for sprint planning. To create and share story cards, try using a work management tool. 

<b>Conversation: </b>A discussion between customers, users, and developers around the priority and potential solutions to the user story.

<b>Confirmation:</b> An agreement between stakeholders that user story objectives and solutions have been reached.

The 3 Cs help to break down a user story into simple tasks. This gives a clear direction for involved stakeholders.



### What makes a Good User Story?
Agile teams assess the quality of stories by using the INVEST acronym. This stands for:

* <b>Independent</b>: The user story should be independent of all others. Because they are not connected, they can be worked on in any order.
* <b>Negotiable:<b> A user story should be flexible enough to allow for negotiation between the customer and product owner.
* <b>Valuable: </b>What value does the user story bring? If you cannot find any value, the story should not be completed.
* Estimable: You should be able to estimate how long a user story will take so that you can effectively manage your time.
* <b>Small:</b> The story must be small enough to be completed within a single sprint.
* <b>Testable:</b> You must be able to test your user story in line with quality assurance standards.


### How to write a good user story
A user story is written in three steps and represents the end user’s viewpoint. 


The three steps of writing a user story are:

* <b>Persona:</b> The end user’s character

* <b>Need: </b>The goal the software feature has on the end user’s journey

* <b>Purpose:</b> The goal of the end user’s experience with the software feature

Your user story should contain all three of these components. Let’s dig into each of these elements to give you a better understanding of how to write an effective user story. 



##### Step 1. Identify the persona
Identify the end user’s persona by evaluating your target audience. Consider who will be impacted by the software feature. 

Here are some questions to ask yourself and your team when identifying the user persona:

Who are we building this software feature for?

What kind of product features does the end user want?

What are the demographics and psychographics of the end user?

There may be multiple personas in a given user story depending on the size of the target audience. 

Example persona: Kat, a project manager who leads 10 team members

##### Step 2. Describe the need
Describe how the end user will use your software feature and why. This is critical so your team understands why the target audience would use your feature in the first place. 

Consider these questions when analyzing the intent of the end user:

What is the end user trying to accomplish?

How will your software feature help the end user accomplish their goals?

Avoid focusing on the specific features—instead, consider what the end user is searching for and how your software will help them reach their goals. 

Example need: Help team members understand how individual tasks contribute to larger business goals

#####Step 3. Define the purpose
Define the purpose by analyzing the bigger picture of the software release. Consider how the software feature fits into your internal goals. 

Ask yourself these questions to help define the purpose:

What’s the benefit of the software feature?

What is the problem that’s being solved?

How does this fit into larger goals?

The purpose here is to define the value of your software feature related to big-picture goals.

Example purpose: To increase efficiency by creating a clear path

### Benefits of user stories
Why write user stories in the first place? Because they offer numerous benefits for an Agile project. Here are a few examples:

* <b>Simplified format:</b> User stories are written in easy-to-understand language. This eliminates confusion and makes it easier to grasp what the customer is looking for.
* <b>Increased flexibility:</b> Because user stories don’t go into technical detail, they can be molded to fit changing situations.
* <b>Improved collaboration:</b> When team members are aligned on one goal, they can work better together and collaborate easily with other project stakeholders.

Though the benefits of writing user stories are significant, a product manager must also consider the potential disadvantages.




### Disadvantages of user stories
Here are a few user story pitfalls to watch out for:

* Incomplete stories: Though the language is intended to be informal, sometimes user stories are far too vague and exclude necessary details.
* Insufficient time: Writing a good story takes time. It requires extensive research and regular communication with stakeholders, a fact that is sometimes overlooked.
* Narrow vision: Because user stories focus on one single requirement, they can be hard to scale, and teams can sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture (in this case, an epic).
Before you start your story, take some time to identify potential risks or disadvantages and outline how you aim to counteract them.
