# SDLC

oftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the steps involved in the development of software at each phase. It covers the detailed plan for building, deploying and maintaining the software.

SDLC defines the complete cycle of development i.e. all the tasks involved in planning, creating, testing, and deploying a Software Product.

## SDLC Process
SDLC is a process that defines the various stages involved in the development of software for delivering a high-quality product. SDLC stages cover the complete life cycle of a software i.e. from inception to retirement of the product.

Adhering to the SDLC process leads to the development of the software in a systematic and disciplined manner.

## Purpose:
Purpose of SDLC is to deliver a high-quality product which is as per the customer’s requirement.

SDLC has defined its phases as, Requirement gathering, Designing, Coding, Testing, and Maintenance. It is important to adhere to the phases to provide the Product in a systematic manner.

For Example, A software has to be developed and a team is divided to work on a feature of the product and is allowed to work as they want. One of the developers decides to design first whereas the other decides to code first and the other on the documentation part.

This will lead to project failure because of which it is necessary to have a good knowledge and understanding among the team members to deliver an expected product.

### SDLC Phases
- Below are the various phases:
- Requirement gathering and analysis
- Design
- Implementation or coding
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance.

### SDLC Phases in Detail
1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
    During this phase, all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expectation. Any ambiguities must be resolved in this phase only.

    Business analyst and Project Manager set up a meeting with the customer to gather all the information like what the customer wants to build, who will be the end-user, what is the purpose of the product. Before building a product a core understanding or knowledge of the product is very important.

    For Example, A customer wants to have an application which involves money transactions. In this case, the requirement has to be clear like what kind of transactions will be done, how it will be done, in which currency it will be done, etc.

    Once the requirement gathering is done, an analysis is done to check the feasibility of the development of a product. In case of any ambiguity, a call is set up for further discussion.

    Once the requirement is clearly understood, the SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is created. This document should be thoroughly understood by the developers and also should be reviewed by the customer for future reference.

2.Design
    In this phase, the requirement gathered in the SRS document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for implementing system development is derived.

3. Implementation or Coding
    Implementation/Coding starts once the developer gets the Design document. The Software design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented in this phase.

4. Testing
    Testing starts once the coding is complete and the modules are released for testing. In this phase, the developed software is tested thoroughly and any defects found are assigned to developers to get them fixed.

    Retesting, regression testing is done until the point at which the software is as per the customer’s expectation. Testers refer SRS document to make sure that the software is as per the customer’s standard.

5.Deployment
    Once the product is tested, it is deployed in the production environment or first UAT (User Acceptance testing) is done depending on the customer expectation. In the case of UAT, a replica of the production environment is created and the customer along with the developers does the testing. If the customer finds the application as expected, then sign off is provided by the customer to go live.

6. Maintenance
    After the deployment of a product on the production environment, maintenance of the product i.e. if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers.

## Waterfall VS Agile Model
Agile and Waterfall are two well-known project management methodologies. Both of them are popular in software development but each is best suited for different types of projects. 

The key difference between Agile vs. Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases that flow into each other, while Agile advocates iterative development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel.

Whether an organization develops applications with an Agile- or Waterfall-based methodology, all software development projects incorporate common aspects of lifecycle phases, including:
- requirements gathering;
- analysis and design;
- development and implementation;
- testing and verification; and
- deployment and ongoing maintenance.

### How does Waterfall work?
The Waterfall model treats each software development lifecycle phase as distinct, isolated events. Development teams must complete each phase in its entirety before they move onto the next phase.

Furthermore, once teams move onto a new phase, they are not allowed to revisit a previous one. Progress through the development phases flows in only one direction, from the top to the bottom -- just like flow of a waterfall, which is where the model's name comes from.

### Why does Agile reject Waterfall?

By the 1990s, developers began to reject the rigid structure of the Waterfall method of software development. This led to the emergence of new software development models such as:

- Extreme programming (XP)
- Scrum and Kanban
- The dynamic system development method (DSDM)
- Feature-driven development
- Crystal
- Pragmatic programming

In February 2001, representatives of these emergent software development models drafted and signed an Agile Manifesto. This is why Scrum, Kanban, XP and DSDM are often referred to as Agile methodologies, despite the fact that they were all in use long before the manifesto was signed.

The Agile Manifesto is short, less than 500 words in length. It simply contains a set of four values and 12 Agile principles. A few of the notable Manifesto entries that contrast Agile against Waterfall include the following:

The Agile Manifesto is short, less than 500 words in length. It simply contains a set of four values and 12 Agile principles. A few of the notable Manifesto entries that contrast Agile against Waterfall include the following:

- Teams should prioritize "responding to change over following a plan."
- Teams emphasize "working software over comprehensive documentation."
- Changes to requirements are welcomed, "even late in development."
- Agile teams should "deliver working software frequently."
- Agile's highest priority is the "early and continuous delivery of valuable software."


### How do Waterfall and Agile compare?

Agile practitioners know that in the world of software development, things never go according to plan. Therefore, the impetus to continuously delivery software into the hands of the client is arguably the primary difference between Waterfall and Agile.

Waterfall asserts that customer feedback and stakeholder interactions need not occur until the end-product is delivered. However, Agile practitioners believe the following:

- Requirements can become outdated before development even begins.
- New technologies can force changes to even the best designs.
- Wireframes and visual renderings don't always translate well into webpages and mobile apps.
- Revised stakeholder priorities can shift development timelines and efforts.

Waterfall does not deal with these situations well.


### When is Waterfall better than Agile?

The Waterfall model has its roots in construction, engineering and manufacturing dating back to the 1950s. The traditional Waterfall model was repurposed for the world of software engineering in the 1970s.

It makes sense to use a Waterfall methodology to build a house. You don't want to pour the basement for a two-bedroom home, only to have the client decide they want a six-bedroom mansion.

Similarly, when you manufacture a car, you give the keys to the owner after it's fully built. You don't ask the purchaser for feedback as the car goes through the assembly line.

For software development, such rigidity isn't helpful.

For software projects, if the requirements are clearly defined upfront with minimal probability for any changes between the time the software is requisitioned and when it is delivered, then the Waterfall method makes sense.

### When should you choose Agile over Waterfall?

For software development projects that involve ongoing engagement between the development team and the project stakeholders, choose Agile over Waterfall.

There was a time 30 years ago where applications were developed in isolated silos and stakeholders and developers never interacted face to face. In modern software development environments, developers and stakeholders are often colocated in the same building and can easily converse in a hallway or over a cubicle wall.

Choose Agile, not Waterfall, when developers and stakeholders can easily exchange feedback and be transparent about the development process.

### What are advantages of Agile vs. Waterfall?

Most organizations choose to take an Agile approach for the following five reasons:

-Agile encourages testing and validation earlier in the software development lifecycle.
- Continuous delivery in Agile is consistent with the DevOps' continuous deployment model.
- The Agile feedback loop more directly involves stakeholders in the development process.
- Agile makes it easier to adapt to changed requirements midway through development.
- Agile projects are easier to start because development doesn't depend on complete requirements and analysis cycles.
